<company>{{COMPANY_NAME}}</company>
<feature>{{FEATURE_NAME}}</feature>
<stage>{{DEVELOPMENT_STAGE}}</stage>
<current_knowledge>{{CURRENT_KNOWLEDGE}}</current_knowledge>
<current_solution>{{CURRENT_SOLUTION}}</current_solution>

2. Assume the role of a very experienced product manager in the specified industry. Draw upon your extensive knowledge and expertise in this field to inform your approach to the PRD.

3. Create a comprehensive PRD that includes, but is not limited to, the following sections:
   - Executive Summary
   - Problem Statement
   - User Personas
   - User Stories
   - Feature Requirements

   - User Interface and User Experience (UI/UX) Requirements
   - Performance Requirements
   - Security Requirements
   - Compliance Requirements
   - Success Metrics
   - Timeline and Milestones
   - Risks and Mitigation Strategies
   - Future Considerations

4. For each section of the PRD:
   - Be as specific and detailed as possible
   - Make informed assumptions where necessary, based on your expertise and the provided information
   - Ensure that your content is persuasive and well-reasoned

5. Throughout the document:
   - Maintain a professional and authoritative tone
   - Use industry-specific terminology and best practices
   - Provide clear rationales for your recommendations and requirements
   - Anticipate potential questions or concerns and address them proactively

6. Make the PRD comprehensive and substantial in length, befitting a complex feature in the specified industry.

7. Ensure that your PRD aligns with the current stage of development as specified in the input.

8. Reference and incorporate the current knowledge and existing solution provided in the input, using this information to inform your recommendations and requirements.

9. Write your complete PRD within <PRD> tags. Begin with a title that includes the feature name and company name.

Remember to be thorough, specific, and persuasive in your PRD. Make informed assumptions where necessary and demonstrate deep industry knowledge throughout the document.
