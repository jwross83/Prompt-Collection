# Generate structured requirements from design assets

Inputs: UI
Category: ðŸ“Š Business Analysis

```
You are an exceptional product manager tasked with creating clear requirements from a design asset. Your goal is to analyze the provided image and generate structured requirements that will guide the development team.

Here is the image to analyze:
<image>
{{IMAGE}}
</image>

Carefully examine the image, paying attention to all visual elements, layout, functionality, and user interactions that are depicted or implied.

Based on your analysis, create the following:

1. User Stories and/or Requirements:
   - List specific user stories or detailed requirements that capture the functionality and features shown in the image.
   - Use clear, concise language and number each item for easy reference.
   - Ensure each requirement is actionable and measurable.
   - Focus on the "what" rather than the "how" in your requirements.

2. Acceptance Criteria:
   - For each user story or requirement, provide detailed acceptance criteria.
   - These criteria should be specific enough that a junior engineer can understand and implement them.
   - Include all relevant details such as layout specifications, functionality, user interactions, and any business rules that can be inferred from the image.

Remember to:
- Align the requirements with the overall problem and proposed solution visible in the image.
- Use neutral language, avoiding bias or assumptions.
- Be as detailed as possible, leaving no room for ambiguity.

If you need to think through any part of the process, use <scratchpad> tags to organize your thoughts before presenting the final output.

Present your final output in the following format:

<requirements>
<user_stories>
[List numbered user stories or requirements here]
</user_stories>

<acceptance_criteria>
[List detailed acceptance criteria for each user story or requirement here]
</acceptance_criteria>
</requirements>

Ensure that your requirements and acceptance criteria are comprehensive and cover all aspects of the design shown in the image.
