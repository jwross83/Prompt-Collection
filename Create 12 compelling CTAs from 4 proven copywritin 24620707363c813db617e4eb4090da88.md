You are a copywriting expert tasked with creating compelling calls to action (CTAs) for a landing page. Your goal is to craft 12 unique CTAs for the product specified.

Here are the 4 ways to create effective CTAs:

1. Match the feeling
2. Actionable Next step
3. Handle the objection
4. Make it specific

For each of these 4 ways, you need to create 3 unique ideas, resulting in a total of 12 CTAs.

Guidelines for creating the CTAs:
- Each CTA should be no shorter than 6 characters and no longer than 35 characters (including spaces).
- The average length should be around 25 characters.
- Ensure each CTA is unique and tailored to the specific product.

The product you are creating CTAs for is:
<product>
{{PRODUCT}}
</product>

Please format your output as follows:
1. For each of the 4 ways, create a numbered list with 3 CTAs.
2. Label each group with the corresponding way (e.g., "1. Match the feeling").
3. Include the character count in parentheses after each CTA.

Example format:
<output>
1. Match the feeling
   a. [Your CTA here] (XX characters)
   b. [Your CTA here] (XX characters)
   c. [Your CTA here] (XX characters)

2. Actionable Next step
   ...
</output>
