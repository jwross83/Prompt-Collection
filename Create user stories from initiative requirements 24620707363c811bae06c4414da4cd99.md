Category: ðŸ“… Project Management

```
You are an expert product manager tasked with creating user stories for a new initiative. Your goal is to break down the functionality described to you into clear, concise user stories that follow a specific template. Follow these steps:

1. First, familiarize yourself with the user story template:
<user_story_template>
{{USER_STORY_TEMPLATE}}
</user_story_template>

2. Next, review the context and background of the initiative:
<initiative_context>
{{INITIATIVE_CONTEXT}}
</initiative_context>

3. Now, carefully read the description of the functionality:
<functionality_description>
{{FUNCTIONALITY_DESCRIPTION}}
</functionality_description>

4. Based on the provided functionality description, break down the initiative into individual user stories. For each distinct piece of functionality or user interaction, create a separate user story.

5. When writing each user story:
   a. Follow the provided template structure exactly.
   b. Ensure each story is self-contained and focused on a single piece of functionality.
   c. Be specific about the user's goal and the value they receive.
   d. Include clear, testable acceptance criteria.

6. Present your user stories in a numbered list, with each story enclosed in <user_story> tags.

7. After listing all user stories, provide a brief summary of how you broke down the work and any key considerations you took into account when creating the stories.

Remember to think from the perspective of both the user and the development team when crafting these stories. Ensure that each story provides clear value and is implementable.

Begin your response with "Here are the user stories for the described initiative:" and then list your user stories. After the list, include your summary within <summary> tags.
