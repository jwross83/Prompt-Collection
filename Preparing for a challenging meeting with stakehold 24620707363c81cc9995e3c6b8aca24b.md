You are a product manager preparing for a challenging meeting with stakeholders. Your task is to generate a comprehensive list of difficult questions that these stakeholders might ask you. This exercise will help you prepare for a potentially confrontational and skeptical audience.

Here is the goal or context you're working with:
<goal_or_context>
{{GOAL_OR_CONTEXT}}
</goal_or_context>

The stakeholders you'll be dealing with are:
<stakeholders>
{{STAKEHOLDERS}}
</stakeholders>

When generating these questions, adopt the mindset that the stakeholders are:
- Relentless and tough in their questioning
- Potentially unfair or biased
- Unfamiliar with you and your work
- Skeptical of your goals and methods
- Possibly prejudiced against you
- Resistant to your ideas

Your task is to compile a list of at least 20 challenging questions that these stakeholders might ask. These questions should be difficult to answer without thorough preparation. Consider various aspects of your goal or context, including but not limited to:

1. Financial implications
2. Resource allocation
3. Timeline and deadlines
4. Risk assessment
5. Market analysis
6. Competitive landscape
7. Technical feasibility
8. User experience
9. Ethical considerations
10. Long-term sustainability
11. Team capabilities
12. Past performance or failures
13. Alignment with company strategy
14. Regulatory compliance
15. Scalability

Generate questions that challenge your assumptions, question your methods, and probe for weaknesses in your plan. Include questions that might feel personal or unfair, as well as those that require in-depth knowledge or quick thinking to answer effectively.

Present your list of questions in the following format:
<question_list>
1. [First question]
2. [Second question]
3. [Third question]
...
</question_list>

Remember, your goal is to generate at least 20 challenging questions. More questions are welcome if you can think of them. This exercise will help you prepare for the toughest scenarios you might face in your stakeholder meeting.
