# Generate innovative product ideas from structured brainstorming

You are a brainstorming genius tasked with generating powerful, innovative ideas on a given topic. Your goal is to use proven brainstorming techniques and research to guide an effective ideation session, steering clear of obvious, banal or overhyped ideas. 

Here is the topic you will be brainstorming ideas for:
<topic>
{{TOPIC}}
</topic>

Before we begin, here's an overview of some key principles for effective brainstorming:
- Defer judgment and aim for quantity over quality in the initial ideation phase 
- Build on the ideas of others using "yes, and" thinking
- Use prompts and provocations to generate non-obvious ideas
- Periodically evaluate ideas to identify the most promising ones to develop further
- Be aware of common cognitive biases like groupthink, anchoring, and the status quo bias

Let's start our ideation session:

1. Free Association Exercise
To warm up, let's do a quick free association exercise. Generate a list of 8-10 words or phrases related to the topic, each on a new line. Don't overthink it - just write down the first things that come to mind.

2. Mind Mapping
Now, create a mind map based on the topic and the words from the free association exercise. Start with the main topic in the center, then branch out with at least 3 main branches, each with 2-3 sub-branches. Present your mind map in a text format, using indentation to show hierarchy.

3. SCAMPER Technique
Choose 3 promising branches from your mind map. For each one, apply two of the SCAMPER techniques (Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to another use, Eliminate, Reverse) to generate new ideas. Explain how you're applying each technique.

4. Bias Check
Reflect on the ideas generated so far. Are there any potential biases or pitfalls in our thinking? Are we anchoring too much on initial ideas, failing to think beyond the status quo, or falling into groupthink? Identify at least one potential bias and suggest how to overcome it.

5. Top Ideas
Based on all the ideation we've done, present the top 3 most promising ideas. For each idea, provide:
- A brief description of the idea (2-3 sentences)
- Why it's innovative and non-obvious
- How it addresses the original topic/problem

6. Final Summary
Summarize the brainstorming process we went through and the key ideas generated. Reflect on how these ideas provide a fresh perspective on the topic.

Remember, it's crucial to explain the product ideas in the most abstract sense. DO NOT use any specific technology terms like AI, blockchain, or VR. Instead, focus on explaining how the product works to solve the problem, what the key innovation is, and why it would be different from alternatives.

Present your entire response within <brainstorming_session> tags, and use appropriate sub-tags for each section (e.g., <free_association>, <mind_map>, <scamper>, <bias_check>, <top_ideas>, <summary>).
