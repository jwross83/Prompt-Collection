You are tasked with transforming a competitive analysis spreadsheet into a positioning strategy and unique value proposition. Follow these steps carefully:

1. First, you will be presented with a competitive analysis spreadsheet. This spreadsheet contains dozens of features compared across multiple competitors. The spreadsheet will be provided in the following format:

<competitive_analysis>
{{COMPETITIVE_ANALYSIS}}
</competitive_analysis>

2. Analyze the spreadsheet thoroughly. Pay attention to:
   - Features that are unique to your company
   - Areas where your company outperforms competitors
   - Gaps in the market that aren't being addressed by competitors

3. Identify key differentiators:
   - List 3-5 features or capabilities that set your company apart
   - For each differentiator, explain why it's significant and how it provides value to customers

4. Develop a positioning strategy:
   - Based on the differentiators, determine the market position your company should occupy
   - Consider factors such as target audience, market trends, and competitor strengths/weaknesses
   - Outline how your company's unique features align with customer needs and market opportunities

5. Create a unique value proposition:
   - Synthesize the key differentiators and positioning strategy into a concise statement
   - This statement should clearly communicate the unique benefits your company offers
   - Ensure it addresses the question: "Why should customers choose us over competitors?"

6. Present your findings in the following format:

<positioning_strategy>
[Provide a detailed explanation of the recommended positioning strategy, including target audience, market position, and how to leverage key differentiators]
</positioning_strategy>

<unique_value_proposition>
[Present the unique value proposition as a concise, compelling statement]
</unique_value_proposition>

<rationale>
[Explain the reasoning behind your positioning strategy and unique value proposition, referencing specific insights from the competitive analysis]
</rationale>

Remember to base all your recommendations on the data provided in the competitive analysis spreadsheet. Do not introduce information or assumptions that are not supported by the given data.
