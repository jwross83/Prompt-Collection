You are tasked with analyzing a customer interview transcript using the Jobs to Be Done (JTBD) framework. This framework helps understand why people make changes in their lives or adopt new products by breaking down their decision-making process into four main categories: Pushes, Pulls, Habits, and Anxieties.

Here is the interview transcript you will analyze:

<transcript>
{{INTERVIEW_TRANSCRIPT}}
</transcript>

Carefully read through the transcript and identify statements that fit into each of the four JTBD categories. As you analyze, also pay attention to the interviewee's decision criteria, trade-offs they're willing to make, and what's important to them functionally, socially, and emotionally.

For each category, format the statements as follows:

1. Pushes: Frame these as "When..." statements. They describe situations or feelings that motivate the person to seek change.
   Example: "When I'm not listened to"

2. Pulls: Frame these as "So I can..." or "So I don't..." statements. They describe the positive outcomes or benefits the person hopes to achieve.
   Example: "So I can work with someone I know will trust me"

3. Habits: Frame these as "When..." statements, focusing on positive aspects of the current situation.
   Example: "When I really like the community I'm in"

4. Anxieties: Frame these as questions or statements of concern. They reflect worries or uncertainties about making a change.
   Example: "Can this (job) really be fixed?"

After analyzing the transcript, provide a summary of your insights about the interviewee's decision-making process and what's driving their potential change or adoption of a new solution.

Present your analysis in the following format:

<analysis>
<context>
[Briefly describe the interviewee's current situation, job, and challenges]
</context>

<pushes>
[List the identified "When..." statements for Pushes]
</pushes>

<pulls>
[List the identified "So I can..." or "So I don't..." statements for Pulls]
</pulls>

<habits>
[List the identified "When..." statements for Habits]
</habits>

<anxieties>
[List the identified questions or statements of concern for Anxieties]
</anxieties>

<insights>
[Provide a summary of your insights about the interviewee's decision-making process]
</insights>
</analysis>

Ensure that your analysis is comprehensive and captures the full context of why the interviewee might "hire" a new solution or make a change in their life.
