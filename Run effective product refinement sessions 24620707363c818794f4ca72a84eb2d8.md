# Product Refinement Session Guide
## Purpose
A refinement session is NOT about estimating solutions, but rather:
- Understanding problems deeply
- Determining solution requirements
- Building shared team understanding
- Defining clear success criteria
## Pre-Session Preparation
### For Product Manager/Owner
1. Identify key items for refinement
   - Select items that align with current priorities
   - Focus on problems that need immediate attention
2. Share materials in advance
   - Distribute selected items to team 24 hours before session
   - Give team time to review and reflect
   - Include any relevant context or background information
### For Team Members
1. Review shared materials
2. Note initial questions and concerns
3. Consider potential problem areas that need clarification
## During the Session
### 1. Context Setting (15-20 minutes)
- PM/PO clearly articulates:
  - Current business priorities
  - Strategic context
  - Why these items matter now
  - How they align with broader goals
### 2. Problem Space Exploration (40-45 minutes)
- Discuss each refinement item:
  - Define the core problem
  - Identify affected stakeholders
  - Map out dependencies
  - Document constraints
  - Clarify assumptions
### 3. Success Criteria Definition (20-25 minutes)
- Define clear outcomes:
  - What does success look like?
  - How will we measure it?
  - What are the acceptance criteria?
  - What are the non-negotiables?
### 4. Discussion Management
- Timeboxed conversations
- Park tangential discussions
- Document open questions
- Capture action items
### 5. Session Retrospective (10-15 minutes)
- Gather feedback on:
  - Session effectiveness
  - Discussion quality
  - Time management
  - Areas for improvement
  - What worked well
## Post-Session Actions
### 1. Documentation
- Update refinement items with new insights
- Document decisions and rationale
- Share session notes
### 2. Follow-up
- Address parked items
- Schedule any needed deep-dives
- Assign action items
### 3. Preparation for Next Session
- Apply retrospective feedback
- Begin identifying next batch of items
- Update session format based on team input
## Success Indicators
- Team has clear understanding of problems
- Success criteria are well-defined
- Next steps are clearly documented
- Team is aligned on priorities
- Everyone understands their role in solution development
## Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Jumping to solutions too quickly
- Not timeboxing discussions
- Lack of preparation
- Missing key stakeholders
- Focusing on estimation instead of understanding

Carefully read through the guide and familiarize yourself with its contents. Pay attention to the purpose, preparation steps, session structure, and best practices outlined in the guide.
Now, prepare for a refinement session on the following topic:
<session_topic>
{{TOPIC}}
</session_topic>
Based on the refinement guide and the session topic, please do the following:
1. Create an agenda for the refinement session. Include timeboxed sections that align with the guide's recommendations. Present your agenda in <agenda> tags.
2. Provide a summary of 3-5 key points from the refinement guide that are particularly relevant to this session topic. Present your summary in <key_points> tags.
3. Generate 3-5 potential discussion questions that the product manager could use to facilitate the problem space exploration part of the session. These questions should be specific to the session topic and align with the guide's recommendations. Present your questions in <discussion_questions> tags.
4. Write a brief closing statement (2-3 sentences) that the product manager could use to wrap up the session, emphasizing the importance of the refinement process and next steps. Present your closing statement in <closing_statement> tags.
Remember to tailor your responses to the specific session topic while adhering to the best practices outlined in the refinement guide.
