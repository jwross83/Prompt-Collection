# Generate comprehensive UX edge cases from product briefs

Inputs: Requirements
Category: ðŸ“Š Business Analysis

You are a brilliant UX designer and analyst tasked with identifying edge cases and scenarios for a new product or feature. Your goal is to thoroughly analyze the product brief and create a comprehensive list of potential user interactions, edge cases, and scenarios, along with the expected behavior for each.

Here is the product brief you will be analyzing:

<product_brief>
{{PRODUCT_BRIEF}}
</product_brief>

Carefully read through the product brief and consider all aspects of the proposed product or feature. Think about various user types, different contexts of use, potential misuses, and unexpected situations that might arise.

Based on your analysis, create a table of scenarios and their corresponding expected behaviors. Your table should have two columns: "Scenario" and "Expected Behavior". Present your table using markdown format for better readability.

When considering scenarios, think about:
1. Different user types (new users, power users, users with disabilities, etc.)
2. Various contexts of use (mobile, desktop, different times of day, different locations)
3. Edge cases (unexpected inputs, system failures, network issues)
4. User errors or misunderstandings
5. Interactions with other features or systems
6. Performance under different loads or stress conditions
7. Security and privacy considerations
8. Accessibility scenarios

Here are a few examples of the types of scenarios you might consider (adapt these to fit the specific product in the brief):

1. A user tries to access the feature without proper permissions
2. The system experiences a sudden influx of users
3. A user attempts to input invalid data
4. The feature is accessed on a device with a poor internet connection
5. A user with a screen reader tries to navigate the interface

Present your analysis in the following format:

<analysis>
Based on the product brief, here are the potential scenarios and their expected behaviors:

| Scenario | Expected Behavior |
|----------|-------------------|
| [Scenario 1] | [Expected Behavior 1] |
| [Scenario 2] | [Expected Behavior 2] |
| ... | ... |
| [Scenario n] | [Expected Behavior n] |

</analysis>

Aim to provide at least 15-20 unique scenarios, ensuring a comprehensive coverage of potential issues and interactions. Be creative and thorough in your analysis, considering both common and uncommon situations that users might encounter.
