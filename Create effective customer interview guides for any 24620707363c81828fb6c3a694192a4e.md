Your task is to create a comprehensive discussion guide for customer interviews based on a given topic. This guide will be used to gather insights for feature development. Here's the topic for the customer interview:

<topic>
{{TOPIC}}
</topic>

To create an effective discussion guide, follow these steps:

1. Analyze the topic:
Wrap your work in <thinking> tags:
- List 3-5 key components of the topic
- Identify 3-5 potential areas of interest for customer interviews
- Consider the broader context and implications of the topic

2. Outline the discussion guide structure:
Wrap your work in <thinking> tags:
- Create a bullet-point outline of the interview flow
- Determine key sections (e.g., introduction, current situation, challenges, desired outcomes, potential solutions, wrap-up)
- Consider how to prioritize questions within each section

3. Formulate questions for each section:
Wrap your work in <thinking> tags:
- For each section, write 2-3 sample open-ended questions that encourage detailed responses
- Critique each question for effectiveness, potential bias, and adherence to best practices (e.g., focusing on past behaviors, avoiding leading questions)
- Ensure questions explore the customer's current workflow, pain points, and desired outcomes
- Refine questions based on your critique

4. Review and refine the guide:
Wrap your work in <thinking> tags:
- List pros and cons of the overall guide structure and content
- Ensure adherence to principles of "The Mom Test" and Teresa Torres' "Continuous Discovery Habits"
- Check that questions are prioritized effectively within each section
- Identify any gaps in information gathering and suggest additional questions if necessary
- Propose potential improvements or refinements based on your analysis

Present your final discussion guide using the following format:

<discussion_guide>
[Brief introduction for the interviewer, explaining the purpose of the interview and key points to remember]

1. Introduction and Warm-up
   1.1. [Question]
   1.2. [Question]
   [Additional questions as needed]

2. Current Situation and Workflow
   2.1. [Question]
   2.2. [Question]
   [Additional questions as needed]

3. Challenges and Pain Points
   3.1. [Question]
   3.2. [Question]
   [Additional questions as needed]

4. Desired Outcomes and Goals
   4.1. [Question]
   4.2. [Question]
   [Additional questions as needed]

5. Exploration of Potential Solutions
   5.1. [Question]
   5.2. [Question]
   [Additional questions as needed]

6. Wrap-up and Next Steps
   6.1. [Question]
   6.2. [Question]
   [Additional questions as needed]
</discussion_guide>

Remember to:
- Use a friendly, professional tone in your questions
- Number each question
- Group questions under appropriate headings
- Include brief explanations or prompts for the interviewer in [brackets] where necessary
- Prioritize the most important questions at the top of each section

After creating the guide, review it once more:
Wrap your work in <thinking> tags:
- Evaluate the effectiveness of each question in gathering actionable insights
- Ensure the guide allows for flexibility in the conversation while covering all crucial areas
- Confirm that the most critical questions are prioritized at the beginning of each section
- Identify any potential improvements or refinements

Make any necessary adjustments based on your final review before presenting the completed discussion guide.

Your final output should consist only of the discussion guide and should not duplicate or rehash any of the work you did in the thinking blocks.
