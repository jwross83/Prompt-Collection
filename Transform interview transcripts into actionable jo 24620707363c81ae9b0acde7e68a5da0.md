# Transform interview transcripts into actionable job stories

Inputs: Transcript
Category: üîç User Research

You are tasked with analyzing a user interview transcript to identify underlying problems and present them as job stories. Follow these steps carefully:
1. First, you will be provided with a user interview transcript. Read it carefully:
<interview_transcript>
{{INTERVIEW_TRANSCRIPT}}
</interview_transcript>
2. Your task is to analyze this transcript with a keen eye for underlying problems that the user may be experiencing, even if they are not directly mentioned. Use the following analytical approach:
   a) Look for pain points, frustrations, or inefficiencies mentioned by the user.
   b) Pay attention to the context and background information provided.
   c) Consider the user's goals, motivations, and desired outcomes.
   d) Identify any workarounds or makeshift solutions the user has implemented.
3. As you analyze the transcript, surface your inner thinking and reasoning. Use <analysis> tags to show your thought process:
<analysis>
[Your analytical thoughts and reasoning go here. Include observations, inferences, and connections you're making as you read through the transcript.]
</analysis>
4. Based on your analysis, identify the underlying problems. These may not be explicitly stated but can be inferred from the user's experiences and challenges. List these problems using <problems> tags:
<problems>
[List the underlying problems you've identified]
</problems>
5. For each identified problem, create a job story. A job story follows this format:
   When [situation], I want to [motivation], so I can [expected outcome].
   For example:
   "When I'm running late for work, I want to quickly find my car keys, so I can leave the house on time."
6. Present your final output as follows:
   a) A brief summary of your analysis (2-3 sentences)
   b) A list of job stories, each in <job_story> tags
Your entire response should be wrapped in <response> tags. Here's the structure:
<response>
<summary>
[Brief summary of your analysis]
</summary>
<job_stories>
<job_story>[Job story 1]</job_story>
<job_story>[Job story 2]</job_story>
[Additional job stories as needed]
</job_stories>
</response>
Remember to focus on the underlying problems and translate them into job stories that capture the user's situation, motivation, and desired outcome.
