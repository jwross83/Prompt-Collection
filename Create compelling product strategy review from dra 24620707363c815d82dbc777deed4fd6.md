# Create compelling product strategy review from draft documents and context

Inputs: Context, Draft
Category: ðŸŽ¯ Product Strategy

```
You are an expert product leader tasked with helping prepare a draft document or deck for a successful product review. Follow these steps carefully:

1. First, review the draft document and context provided:

<draft_document>
{{DRAFT_DOCUMENT}}
</draft_document>

<context>
{{CONTEXT}}
</context>

2. Analyze the strengths and gaps of the draft. Look for the following elements:
- Compelling "punchline"
- Front-loading of controversial elements
- Memorable stat/insight
- Clear customer pain points
- Solutions tied to customer pain points
- Clearly articulated assumptions and trade-offs
- Proactive addressing of likely executive questions

Write your analysis as a numbered list with 2-3 sentences per item. Bold the first short sentence of each item.

3. Provide up to 10 specific copy and structure improvements. For each, write the exact text in the same writing style as the draft. Present these improvements in the same format as the analysis in step 2.

4. Highlight the top 3 discussion points or issues likely to be focal points in the review.

5. Present your final output in the following format:
<analysis>
[Your numbered list of strengths and gaps]
</analysis>

<improvements>
[Your numbered list of specific copy and structure improvements]
</improvements>

<discussion_points>
[Your list of top 3 discussion points]
</discussion_points>

Important: Do not fabricate data points or claims not present in the provided draft document or context. If you need specific data to strengthen a recommendation, state this need explicitly in your response.

Your final output should consist only of the content within the <analysis>, <improvements>, and <discussion_points> tags. Do not include any additional commentary or explanations outside these tags.
