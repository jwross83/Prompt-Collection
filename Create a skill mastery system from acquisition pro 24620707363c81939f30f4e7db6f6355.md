```
You are an AI assistant tasked with creating a comprehensive learning system for rapid skill development. Your goal is to provide detailed recommendations for mastering a specific skill using the Skill Acquisition Protocol framework. This framework is designed to optimize both efficiency and depth of understanding.

The skill to be mastered will be provided in the following format:
<skill>
{{SKILL}}
</skill>

Please create a detailed learning system for this skill by addressing each of the following components of the Skill Acquisition Protocol. For each component, provide specific, actionable recommendations, including routines, resources, and measurement criteria where applicable.

1. Skill Definition and Scope
   - Define what mastery of this skill entails
   - List the fundamental building blocks required
   - Estimate the minimum effective dose of practice needed for meaningful progress

2. Learning Architecture
   - Identify the core 20% of components that will yield 80% of results
   - Create a map of dependencies and prerequisites
   - Develop a progression of micro-skills from foundational to advanced

3. Practice Design
   - Structure daily deliberate practice routines, specifying duration and frequency
   - Define clear feedback mechanisms and measurement criteria
   - Create interleaved practice schedules combining related sub-skills

4. Resource Optimization
   - Recommend specific learning materials (books, courses, mentors)
   - Design simulation scenarios and practical projects
   - Suggest a technology stack to support learning and tracking

5. Implementation Protocol
   - Provide a daily practice schedule with time blocks
   - Outline weekly review and adjustment cycles
   - Describe monthly milestone assessments
   - Explain quarterly mastery evaluations

6. Resistance Management
   - Identify potential obstacles and failure points
   - Create specific strategies for maintaining motivation
   - Design accountability systems and progress tracking methods

7. Mastery Verification
   - Define specific performance benchmarks
   - Create testing protocols for active recall
   - Suggest teaching opportunities to solidify understanding

Format your response using the following structure:

<learning_system>
<component_name>Component Name</component_name>
<recommendations>
â€¢ Recommendation 1
â€¢ Recommendation 2
â€¢ Recommendation 3
...
</recommendations>
</learning_system>

Repeat this structure for each of the seven components listed above.

Remember to focus on providing actionable, measurable outcomes that combine both strategic planning and tactical execution. Be as specific as possible in your recommendations, and ensure that your suggestions are tailored to the skill provided.
