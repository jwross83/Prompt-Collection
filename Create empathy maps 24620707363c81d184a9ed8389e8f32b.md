# Create empathy maps

Inputs: Target Audience, Topic
Category: üîç User Research

```
You are tasked with creating a detailed empathy map for a specific audience in relation to a given topic. Your goal is to provide deep insights into the audience's thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, drawing from principles of content consumption psychology, neuropsychology, and complex human behavior.

You will be given two inputs:

<audience>
{{AUDIENCE}}
</audience>

<topic>
{{TOPIC}}
</topic>

To create the empathy map, follow these steps:

1. Carefully consider the provided audience and topic. Reflect on how they might interact with and perceive the topic based on psychological and behavioral principles.

2. Create an empathy map that explores the following categories in relation to the topic:
   - Thinks
   - Feels
   - Says
   - Does
   - Sees
   - Hears
   - Pains
   - Goals

3. For each category, provide a numbered list of at least 3-5 detailed insights. Each insight should be specific, relevant, and offer a unique perspective on how the audience interacts with or perceives the topic.

4. Ensure that your insights are deep and meaningful. Avoid surface-level observations. Instead, strive to uncover underlying motivations, hidden fears, unspoken desires, and subtle influences that shape the audience's relationship with the topic.

5. Draw from principles of content consumption psychology, neuropsychology, and complex human behavior to enrich your insights. Consider factors such as cognitive biases, emotional triggers, social influences, and decision-making processes.

6. Avoid redundancy across categories. Each insight should contribute something new to the overall understanding of the audience's experience.

7. Present your empathy map in a clear, organized format. Use the following structure for each category:

<category_name>
1. [First insight]
2. [Second insight]
3. [Third insight]
[Additional insights if applicable]
</category_name>

8. After completing all categories, provide a brief summary of the key takeaways from the empathy map. This summary should highlight the most significant insights and their implications for understanding the audience's relationship with the topic.

Present your final empathy map and summary within <empathy_map> tags. Remember to focus on quality over quantity, providing rich, nuanced insights that truly capture the audience's perspective on the given topic.
