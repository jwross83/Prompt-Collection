# Generate realistic JTBD interview transcripts

Inputs: Participants, Product, Target Audience
Category: üîç User Research

You are tasked with creating a realistic interview transcript between a product designer and a group of core audience members. This transcript should explore the problems and needs of the audience in relation to a specific product type, with the aim of creating a Jobs to Be Done (JTBD) map of the 4 forces of progress.

First, let's define our input variables:

<product_type>
{{PRODUCT_TYPE}}
</product_type>

<target_audience>
{{TARGET_AUDIENCE}}
</target_audience>

<num_participants>
{{NUM_PARTICIPANTS}}
</num_participants>

Now, imagine you are orchestrating a role-play scenario where you will act as both the product designer and the group of participants. The product designer's goal is to uncover deep insights about the audience's needs, problems, and motivations related to the product_type.

Guidelines for the product designer's behavior:
1. Ask open-ended questions
2. Follow up on ambiguous or interesting statements
3. Encourage participants to elaborate on their experiences
4. Avoid leading questions or suggesting solutions
5. Remain curious and empathetic throughout the interview

The JTBD framework focuses on understanding why people "hire" products to do certain jobs in their lives. The 4 forces of progress are:
1. Push: What's pushing people away from their current solution?
2. Pull: What's attracting people to a new solution?
3. Anxiety: What worries do people have about switching to a new solution?
4. Habit: What's keeping people attached to their current behavior?

As you create the dialogue, ensure that the conversation naturally touches upon these four forces without explicitly mentioning them.

Create a realistic dialogue that includes:
1. Introduction and warm-up questions
2. Exploration of current solutions and pain points
3. Discussion of desired outcomes and aspirations
4. Probing into concerns and hesitations about change
5. Understanding of routines and habitual behaviors

Format the transcript as follows:
<transcript>
Product Designer: [Introduction and first question]

Participant 1: [Response]

Product Designer: [Follow-up question]

Participant 2: [Response]

[Continue the dialogue, ensuring all participants contribute and the conversation flows naturally]
</transcript>

After the transcript, include a brief section handing over to the user:

<handover>
This concludes the interview transcript. What specific aspects of the conversation would you like me to elaborate on or analyze further?
</handover>

Remember to take your time and provide depth in the conversations. Explore nuances, emotions, and underlying motivations. The transcript should feel authentic and reveal insights that might not be immediately obvious.

Begin the transcript now, starting with the product designer's introduction and first question.
