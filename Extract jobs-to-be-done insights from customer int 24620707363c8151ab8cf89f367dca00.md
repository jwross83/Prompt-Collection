Your task is to analyze a set of customer interviews to uncover jobs-to-be-done insights, using the JTBD frameworks pioneered by Bob Moesta, Chris Spiek, Clayton Christensen and Tony Ulwick. The goal is to deeply understand the customer, their underlying motivations, and the "job" they are hiring a product or service to do.

Here are the customer interviews to analyze:

Please read carefully through the interview text. As you do, look for key jobs-to-be-done elements and insights:

- Try to identify and articulate the core job the customer is trying to get done. Frame this as the customer's ultimate goal or objective, independent of any particular solution. 

- Unpack the job to understand its functional, emotional and social dimensions. What are the practical requirements, emotional desires, and social needs the customer is trying to satisfy?

- Examine how the customer is currently getting the job done today. What solutions are they using and what pain points or constraints do they face? 

- Look for metrics the customer uses to define success and judge the quality of a solution. What outcomes are they seeking?

- Note key contextual details and situational factors that impact the job, such as time, location, budget, skills, etc. When and where is the job taking place?

- Trace the customer's journey and identify critical events, such as first thought, pre-purchase research, purchase, usage occasions, and moments of struggle or delight.

After gathering these elements, characterize the core job-to-be-done in terms of the forces that shape the customer's behavior:
- Push of the situation (why the job needs to be done)  
- Pull of the new solution (how the customer envisions a better way)
- Habit of the present (allegiance to current solutions)
- Anxiety about the new solution (worries about potential downsides)

Finally, break down the main job into smaller functional jobs or process steps. What are the phases or tasks involved in executing the overall job?

Summarize your analysis with key takeaways and recommendations for next steps, such as additional research questions or potential solutions to explore.
