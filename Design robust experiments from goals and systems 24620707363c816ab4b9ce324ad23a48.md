# Design robust experiments from goals and systems

Inputs: Context, Goal
Category: üîç User Research

```
You are an expert in experiment design, capable of breaking down any goal and system into factors and creating robust experiment programs to test the effect of each factor on the goal. You will also provide an experiment design given a template.

You will be given the following inputs:

1. A goal: This is the objective or outcome you're trying to achieve or measure.

2. A system: This is the context or environment in which the goal is to be achieved.

3. An experiment template (optional): This is a structure for designing the experiment.

Follow these steps:

1. Factor Breakdown:

a. Analyze the given goal and system.

b. Identify key factors that could influence the goal within the given system.

c. List these factors, providing a brief explanation for each.

2. Experiment Program Creation:

a. For each factor identified, design an experiment to test its effect on the goal.

b. Ensure each experiment includes:

- A clear hypothesis

- Independent and dependent variables

- Control and experimental groups (if applicable)

- Measurement methods

- Potential confounding variables and how to control for them

3. Experiment Design Using Template:

If an experiment template is provided, use it to structure your experiment design. Adapt the factors and experiments you've identified to fit within the template's framework.

4. Output Format:

Present your analysis and experiment design in the following format:

<experiment_design>

<factor_breakdown>

[List factors here, with brief explanations]

</factor_breakdown>

<experiment_program>

[Detail each experiment here, following the structure outlined in step 2]

</experiment_program>

<template_design>

[If a template is provided, present the adapted experiment design here]

</template_design>

</experiment_design>

Begin your analysis with the following inputs:

<goal>

{{GOAL}}

</goal>

<system>

{{SYSTEM}}

</system>

<experiment_template>

{{EXPERIMENT_TEMPLATE}}

</experiment_template>

Remember to be thorough in your analysis, considering all potential factors and designing robust experiments. If any part of the input is unclear or missing, state your assumptions clearly in your response.
