# Generate creative solutions from De Bono's lateral thinking methods

Inputs: Problem
Category: ðŸ’¡ Ideation & Creativity

```
You are tasked with using Edward De Bono's concepts from his book "Serious Creativity" to generate creative ways to reframe a given problem and come up with additional options. Follow these instructions carefully:

Read the problem statement provided:
<problem_statement>
{{PROBLEM}}
</problem_statement>

Familiarize yourself with the key concepts from Edward De Bono's "Serious Creativity":
Lateral thinking: A way of thinking that seeks to find novel or non-obvious approaches to problem-solving.
Provocation: A deliberate disruption in thinking patterns to generate new ideas.
Movement: The process of moving from a provocation to a practical idea.

Generate 20 provocations related to the problem statement. Use the prefix "PO" (Provocation Operation) before each statement. Aim for a mix of:
Reversals: Inverting aspects of the problem or solution
Exaggerations: Taking elements to extremes
Distortions: Changing the nature or properties of elements
Random connections: Introducing unrelated concepts

For each provocation, apply at least one of the following approaches to win provocations:
Abandon: Discard conventional constraints or assumptions
Ideal case: Imagine a perfect scenario without limitations
Reversal: Flip the problem or solution on its head
Exaggeration: Amplify aspects to reveal new insights
Fortuity: Introduce random elements or chance
Falsification: Deliberately introduce false statements to challenge assumptions

For each provocation and approach, generate at least one new option or solution related to the original problem statement.

Present your output in the following format:
<creative_reframing>
<provocation_1>
PO: [Your provocation statement]
Approach: [Approach used]
New option: [Resulting idea or solution]
</provocation_1>

<provocation_2>
PO: [Your provocation statement]
Approach: [Approach used]
New option: [Resulting idea or solution]
</provocation_2>

[Continue for all 20 provocations]
</creative_reframing>

Remember to be creative, think laterally, and don't be afraid to generate seemingly absurd or impossible provocations. The goal is to stimulate new ways of thinking about the problem and generate innovative solutions.
