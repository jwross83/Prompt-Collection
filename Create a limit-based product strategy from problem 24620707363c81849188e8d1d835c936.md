# Create a limit-based product strategy from problem to execution plan

Inputs: Problem
Category: ðŸŽ¯ Product Strategy

```
You are tasked with applying the Limit-Based Product Thinking framework to a given problem or product idea. This framework helps in envisioning the ultimate state of a product or solution and working backwards to create a strategic plan. Follow these steps to analyze the problem and provide insights:

First, carefully read the problem statement:

<problem_statement>
{{PROBLEM_STATEMENT}}
</problem_statement>

Now, apply the Limit-Based Product Thinking framework to this problem by following these steps:

1. Define the Variable of Growth:
   Identify the key dimension that will expand over time or scale in this scenario. This could be total users, compute power, market size, etc.

2. Imagine the Limit (t â†’ âˆž):
   Describe a fully mature, frictionless version of the product or solution if the growth variable could expand indefinitely. Ignore current constraints and focus on ideal user experience, performance, and business metrics.

3. Identify Core Properties of the Limit:
   List the structural or architectural features that must exist for the ideal state to emerge. Consider which stakeholders and interactions would be fully automated or seamless in this limit state.

4. Ask "How Fast Does It Converge?":
   Estimate the growth curve toward the limit, starting from today's baseline. Provide quantified interim milestones at 10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 90% of the "limit," with approximate dates or triggers for each.

5. Ask "How Fast Can You Make It Converge?":
   Identify and prioritize the biggest levers to steepen the growth curve. Consider technical, organizational, and go-to-market strategies. Highlight which move today could unlock 2x acceleration toward the limit.

6. Validate First-Principles Assumptions:
   List critical assumptions about growth, technology, and market forces. For each, suggest experimental evidence or data that would prove or disprove it.

7. Derive Product Vision and Execution Plan:
   Summarize the "limit description" in one clear vision statement. Map out major roadblocks between today and the limit, assigning timelines. Create a rolling 3-phase plan (Foundation, Acceleration, Optimization) with resource allocation recommendations.

After completing these steps, provide your analysis in the following format:

<limit_based_analysis>
1. Growth Variable: [Your identified variable]

2. Limit State Description:
   [Your vivid description of the fully mature state]

3. Core Properties of the Limit:
   [List of key features and interactions]

4. Convergence Estimate:
   [Growth curve and milestones]

5. Acceleration Strategies:
   [Prioritized list of levers to steepen the curve]

6. Critical Assumptions:
   [List of assumptions with validation methods]

7. Product Vision and Execution:
   Vision Statement: [One-sentence summary]
   Roadmap: [Major milestones and timelines]
   3-Phase Plan: [Brief outline of each phase]
   Resource Allocation: [Key recommendations]

Ensure your analysis is thorough, creative, and grounded in the specifics of the problem statement. Your final output should only include the content within the <limit_based_analysis> tags.
