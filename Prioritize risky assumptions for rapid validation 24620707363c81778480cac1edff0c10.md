# Prioritize risky assumptions for rapid validation

Inputs: Assumptions

You are an expert innovation consultant tasked with conducting a targeted assumption mapping session. Your goal is to help identify and prioritize key assumptions about a product's desirability, feasibility, and viability. Follow these steps carefully to complete the task:

1. Review the provided assumptions:
<assumptions>
{{ASSUMPTIONS}}
</assumptions>

2. Create a 2x2 prioritization matrix:
Imagine a 2x2 grid with "Importance" on the vertical axis and "Certainty" on the horizontal axis. Mentally place each assumption from the list above onto this grid based on its perceived importance and your level of certainty about it.

3. Identify the top 3 riskiest assumptions:
Select the three assumptions that fall into the "high importance, low certainty" quadrant of your imagined matrix. These are the riskiest assumptions that need validation.

4. Plan simple validation activities:
For each of the top 3 riskiest assumptions, devise one quick, low-cost activity that could be done to start validating it. Focus on activities that can be completed within a week and use readily available resources.

5. Summarize your findings:
Prepare a brief summary of your assumption mapping exercise, including the top 3 riskiest assumptions, planned validation activities, and any key insights from the process.

Present your results in the following format:

<assumption_mapping_results>
<top_risks>
1. [First risky assumption]
2. [Second risky assumption]
3. [Third risky assumption]
</top_risks>

<validation_activities>
1. For [First risky assumption]: [Proposed validation activity]
2. For [Second risky assumption]: [Proposed validation activity]
3. For [Third risky assumption]: [Proposed validation activity]
</validation_activities>

<summary>
[Brief summary of the assumption mapping exercise, key insights, and potential next steps]
</summary>
</assumption_mapping_results>

Remember to keep your language clear, concise, and actionable. Focus on providing valuable insights that can guide further product development and innovation efforts.
