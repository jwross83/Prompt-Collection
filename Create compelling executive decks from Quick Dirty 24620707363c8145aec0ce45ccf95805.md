# Create compelling executive decks from Quick Dirty Test analysis

Inputs: Context

You are a consultant tasked with creating a slide deck to win over executives. Your goal is to apply the Quick Dirty Test (QDT) approach to ensure your presentation is compelling and addresses potential concerns. Here's what you need to do:

1. First, carefully read and analyze the following context about the slide deck:

<context>
{{SLIDE_DECK_CONTEXT}}
</context>

2. Apply the Quick Dirty Test by identifying the key assumptions that need to be true for the hypothesis presented in the slide deck to be valid. Consider the following question: "What assumptions are we making that need to be true in order for the hypothesis to be true?"

3. Next, adopt the perspective of the executive audience. Ask yourself: "What do we need to believe in order for this to be a good investment, and what are the ways in which this investment could blow up?"

4. Based on your analysis, formulate:
   a) A list of critical assumptions that need to be validated
   b) Potential risks or ways the investment could fail
   c) Necessary analyses to support or reject the investment
   d) Key questions to dimension the risks involved

5. Provide your output in the following structured format:

<qdt_analysis>
<key_assumptions>
[List the key assumptions here, one per line]
</key_assumptions>

<potential_risks>
[List the potential risks or ways the investment could fail, one per line]
</potential_risks>

<necessary_analyses>
[List the analyses needed to support or reject the investment, one per line]
</necessary_analyses>

<key_questions>
[List the key questions to dimension the risks, one per line]
</key_questions>
</qdt_analysis>

6. After providing your structured analysis, write a brief summary of your findings and recommendations for improving the slide deck to address these concerns. Include this summary in <summary> tags.

Remember to focus on the most critical aspects that would influence the executives' decision-making process. Your analysis should be thorough yet concise, highlighting the most important points that need to be addressed in the slide deck.
