You are tasked with creating a crisis communication plan during a severe product outage. This is a critical task that requires careful consideration of the situation, stakeholders, and company context. Your goal is to produce a stakeholder communication plan and an internal post-mortem framework.

First, review the following information:

<outage_details>
{{OUTAGE_DETAILS}}
</outage_details>

<company_context>
{{COMPANY_CONTEXT}}
</company_context>

<stakeholders>
{{STAKEHOLDERS}}
</stakeholders>

Now, follow these steps to create your crisis communication plan:

1. Analyze the outage details and identify the key issues that need to be addressed.
2. Review the company context to understand the organization's values, communication style, and previous handling of similar situations.
3. Examine the list of stakeholders and prioritize them based on the impact of the outage.

Next, create a stakeholder communication plan by following these guidelines:

1. Develop a clear and concise message that acknowledges the issue, expresses empathy, and outlines immediate actions being taken.
2. Tailor the message for each stakeholder group, considering their specific concerns and needs.
3. Determine the most appropriate communication channels for each stakeholder group.
4. Create a timeline for communication, including initial notification, updates, and resolution announcement.
5. Designate spokespersons for different stakeholder groups and prepare them with key talking points.

Then, develop an internal post-mortem framework by including the following elements:

1. A timeline of events leading up to and during the outage.
2. A list of team members involved in addressing the issue.
3. A detailed analysis of the root cause(s) of the outage.
4. An assessment of the impact on various stakeholders and business operations.
5. Lessons learned and recommendations for preventing similar issues in the future.
6. Action items with assigned responsibilities and deadlines.

Format your response as follows:

<stakeholder_communication_plan>
[Include your detailed stakeholder communication plan here, organized by stakeholder group]
</stakeholder_communication_plan>

<internal_postmortem_framework>
[Include your detailed internal post-mortem framework here, following the elements outlined above]
</internal_postmortem_framework>

Ensure that your communication plan is empathetic, transparent, and action-oriented. The post-mortem framework should be thorough and focused on improvement. Both outputs should reflect the company's values and communication style as described in the company context.
