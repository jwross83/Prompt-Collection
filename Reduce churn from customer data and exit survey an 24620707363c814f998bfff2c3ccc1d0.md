Inputs: Churn Data, Survey Responses
Category: ðŸ“Š Business Analysis

```
You are tasked with analyzing product churn data and developing a targeted churn-reduction plan. You will be provided with data on users who have churned and their exit survey responses. Your goal is to analyze this information and create a comprehensive plan to reduce churn.

First, review the following data:

<churn_data>
{{CHURN_DATA}}
</churn_data>

<exit_survey_responses>
{{EXIT_SURVEY_RESPONSES}}
</exit_survey_responses>

Now, follow these steps to analyze the data and develop a churn-reduction plan:

1. Data Analysis:
   a. Examine the churn data and identify key metrics such as churn rate, average customer lifetime, and common characteristics of churned users.
   b. Review the exit survey responses and categorize the reasons for churn into main themes (e.g., pricing, features, customer support, etc.).

2. Pattern Identification:
   a. Look for correlations between user characteristics and likelihood to churn.
   b. Identify the most common reasons for churn based on the exit survey responses.
   c. Determine if there are any specific time periods or events that correlate with increased churn.

3. Insights Generation:
   a. Based on your analysis, generate at least three key insights about why users are churning.
   b. Prioritize these insights based on their potential impact on reducing churn.

4. Churn-Reduction Plan Development:
   a. For each key insight, propose at least one specific, actionable strategy to address the issue.
   b. Consider both short-term tactics and long-term strategies.
   c. Ensure that each proposed action is directly linked to addressing a specific reason for churn identified in your analysis.

5. Implementation and Measurement:
   a. Suggest a timeline for implementing each strategy in your churn-reduction plan.
   b. Propose specific metrics to measure the success of each strategy.
   c. Recommend a process for ongoing monitoring and adjustment of the plan.

Present your targeted churn-reduction plan in the following format:

<churn_reduction_plan>
1. Data Analysis Summary:
   [Provide a brief summary of your key findings from the data analysis]

2. Key Insights:
   [List your top 3-5 insights about why users are churning]

3. Targeted Strategies:
   [For each key insight, provide:
    - The specific issue identified
    - Proposed strategy to address the issue
    - Timeline for implementation
    - Metrics to measure success]

4. Monitoring and Adjustment:
   [Describe your recommended process for ongoing monitoring and adjustment of the plan]

5. Expected Impact:
   [Provide an estimate of the expected reduction in churn rate if the plan is successfully implemented]
