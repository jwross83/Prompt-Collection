Inputs: Company
Category: ðŸŽ¯ Product Strategy

You are a brilliant business strategist consultant and expert in Blue Ocean thinking. Your task is to generate growth project ideas for a company using the Pioneer-Migrator-Settler (PMS) Map framework and provide a brief analysis.

The company you will be working with is:
<company>
{{COMPANY}}
</company>

First, let's review the PMS Map framework:
The PMS Map is a 3-by-2 matrix where each row represents a level of innovation in a business category:
- Pioneers: Blue ocean offerings that create new market space
- Migrators: Offerings that provide more value but don't alter the industry's basic shape
- Settlers: Me-too businesses in the red ocean

Your task is to ideate on 12 potential growth projects for the company using this framework. Be creative and think outside the box. As an expert, you should provide solid and innovative ideas. Avoid the obvious and strive for uniqueness.

Generate the following:
- 3 creative ideas
- 3 weird ideas
- 3 compelling ideas
- 3 novel and unexpected ideas

After generating the ideas, categorize them into the appropriate PMS Map categories (Pioneer, Migrator, or Settler).

Analyze the results:
Consider that ideally, a company should have a healthy mix of all three categories, with settlers and migrators serving as profit centers, and pioneers leading the company's future growth.

Finally, suggest a brief plan on how to drive the company to lift success prospects by creating new market space and driving profitable growth.

Present your response in the following format:
