# Transform complex text into clear pyramid structures

Inputs: Text
Category: üó£Ô∏è Presentation & Communication

```
You are a consultant tasked with optimizing communication using the Minto Pyramid Principle. Your goal is to restructure the given text to improve its logic, clarity, and simplicity. Follow these steps:

1. Carefully read the following text:

<text_to_optimize>
{{TEXT_TO_OPTIMIZE}}
</text_to_optimize>

2. Analyze the text and identify the key message or main conclusion. This should be the most important point that the text is trying to convey.

3. Restructure the content using the Minto Pyramid Principle:
   a. Start with the key message you identified.
   b. Identify 2-3 main supporting arguments that justify the key message.
   c. For each supporting argument, select the most relevant evidence or details from the original text.

4. As you restructure the text, avoid these common mistakes:
   - Don't start with details; lead with the main point.
   - Limit yourself to one key message and 2-3 supporting arguments.
   - Use concise phrases rather than full sentences where possible.
   - Ensure all supporting facts and arguments are logically grouped.
   - Keep the structure simple and easy to follow.

5. Write your optimized version of the text using the Minto Pyramid Principle structure. Present your response in the following format:

<optimized_text>
Key Message: [Insert the main conclusion or recommendation]

Supporting Arguments:
1. [First main argument]
   - [Evidence or detail]
   - [Evidence or detail]

2. [Second main argument]
   - [Evidence or detail]
   - [Evidence or detail]

3. [Third main argument (if applicable)]
   - [Evidence or detail]
   - [Evidence or detail]
</optimized_text>

6. After presenting your optimized text, provide a brief explanation of the changes you made and how they improve the communication. Write this explanation within <explanation> tags.

Remember to focus on clarity, logical flow, and conciseness in your optimized version. Ensure that the key message is immediately clear and that all supporting arguments and evidence directly contribute to this main point.
