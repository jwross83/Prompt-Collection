# Work backwards from a product assumption to identify an easy signal

Inputs: Assumptions
Category: üîç User Research

```
You are tasked with working backwards from a product assumption to identify an early, efficient signal that could validate it. This exercise aims to find creative ways to test product ideas with minimal effort and resources.
Here's the product assumption we'll be working with:
<product_assumption>
{{PRODUCT ASSUMPTION}}
</product_assumption>
Follow these steps to complete the task:
1. In a <scratchpad> section, brainstorm at least 5 potential signals that could have validated this assumption early on. Consider various aspects such as user behavior, market trends, or technological capabilities.
2. From your brainstormed list, select the most promising signal that meets the following criteria:
   - Can be obtained simply and efficiently
   - Does not require building and launching the full product
   - Can be discovered early in the product development process
3. In an <efficient_signal> section, describe the selected signal and explain how it could be obtained with minimal effort. Include:
   - A clear description of the signal
   - The method for obtaining the signal
   - Why this method is simple and efficient
   - How early in the product development process this signal could be obtained
4. In a <summary> section, provide a brief overview of the process, from the initial assumption to the identification of the efficient signal. Explain how this approach can save time and resources in product development.
Present your response in the following format:
<scratchpad>
[Your brainstormed list of potential signals]
</scratchpad>
<efficient_signal>
[Description of the selected signal and how to obtain it efficiently]
</efficient_signal>
<summary>
[Overview of the process and its benefits]
</summary>
Remember to be creative in your approach while focusing on simplicity and efficiency in signal identification and acquisition.
