# Generate a detailed customer journey map based on user behavior data

Inputs: User Behaviour Data
Category: ðŸ“Š Business Analysis

```
You are tasked with creating a detailed customer journey map based on user behavior data. The data will be provided to you, and you should use it to construct a comprehensive map that illustrates the customer's experience.

Here is the user behavior data:

<user_behavior_data>
{{USER_BEHAVIOR_DATA}}
</user_behavior_data>

Your goal is to create a detailed journey map that includes the following elements:

1. Key touchpoints and decision moments
2. Time spent at each stage
3. Points of friction and delight
4. Emotional states mapped to specific interactions
5. Corresponding metrics where available

Follow these steps to create the journey map:

1. Identify key touchpoints and decision moments:
   - Analyze the user behavior data to determine the main stages of the customer journey.
   - Identify critical interactions where customers make important decisions or engage significantly with the product/service.
   - List these touchpoints and decision moments in chronological order.

2. Quantify time spent at each stage:
   - Use the data to calculate the average time users spend at each identified stage or touchpoint.
   - If exact time data is not available, provide estimates based on the information given.
   - Present the time spent in a clear format (e.g., minutes, hours, or days).

3. Highlight points of friction and delight:
   - Identify stages or interactions where users commonly experience difficulties or frustrations.
   - Pinpoint moments where users express satisfaction or positive experiences.
   - Use available metrics (e.g., customer satisfaction scores, abandonment rates) to support your findings.

4. Map emotional states to specific interactions:
   - Based on the data, infer the likely emotional state of users at each stage of the journey.
   - Use indicators such as customer feedback, behavior patterns, or explicit sentiment data if available.
   - Assign emotional states (e.g., confused, frustrated, satisfied, delighted) to each key interaction.

5. Present the analysis with corresponding metrics:
   - For each stage or touchpoint, include relevant metrics that provide insight into user behavior or experience.
   - Examples of metrics could include conversion rates, engagement levels, or customer satisfaction scores.
   - Ensure that all metrics are clearly labeled and explained if necessary.

Format your journey map as follows:

<journey_map>
<stage>
<name>[Stage Name]</name>
<touchpoints>[List key touchpoints]</touchpoints>
<time_spent>[Average time spent]</time_spent>
<friction_points>[Identified friction points]</friction_points>
<delight_points>[Identified delight points]</delight_points>
<emotional_state>[Inferred emotional state]</emotional_state>
<metrics>[Relevant metrics with values]</metrics>
</stage>
[Repeat the <stage> structure for each identified stage in the journey]
</journey_map>

After the structured journey map, provide a brief summary of the key insights and patterns observed in the customer journey. Include any notable trends, major pain points, and areas of opportunity for improvement.

Present your analysis in a clear, organized manner, ensuring that all elements of the journey map are supported by the provided user behavior data. If you make any assumptions or inferences, clearly state them and explain your reasoning.
