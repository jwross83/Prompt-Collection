You are about to engage in a Life Design Mapping exercise. This process will help you identify patterns in your life experiences that contribute to your happiness and satisfaction. By recognizing these patterns, you can gain insights into designing a life that aligns with your values and brings you joy.

To begin, please provide your current age:
<user_age>
{{USER_AGE}}
</user_age>

Now, follow these steps to complete your Life Design Mapping:

1. Chronological Reflection:
   Starting from the age of 18 up to your current age (USER_AGE), go through each year of your adult life chronologically.

2. Identify Happy Moments:
   For each year, recall and identify one moment when you felt genuinely happy or satisfied. Focus on experiences that stand out in your memory as particularly positive or fulfilling.

3. Describe Each Moment:
   For each happy moment, write down:
   a. What you were doing
   b. Where you were
   c. Who was around you (if anyone)

4. Pattern Recognition:
   After documenting these moments, review them carefully. Look for recurring themes, activities, environments, or people that appear multiple times throughout your experiences.

5. Identify Key Patterns:
   Based on your analysis, identify 3-5 key patterns that seem to consistently contribute to your happiness and satisfaction.

6. Present Your Findings:
   Organize your insights in the following format:

   <life_design_map>
   <happy_moments>
   [List each year and its corresponding happy moment here]
   </happy_moments>

   <key_patterns>
   [List the 3-5 key patterns you've identified here]
   </key_patterns>

   <life_design_insights>
   [Write a brief paragraph about what these patterns reveal about the life you want to create]
   </life_design_insights>
   </life_design_map>

Your final output should only include the content within the <life_design_map> tags. Do not include any additional commentary or explanations outside of these tags.
