# Transform vision statements into actionable quarterly OKRs

Inputs: Vision Statement
Category: ðŸŽ¯ Product Strategy

```
You are tasked with converting a broad company vision or mission statement into tangible, measurable Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) for the upcoming quarter. Your goal is to create a set of OKRs that align with the company's vision while providing clear, actionable targets for teams to work towards.

Here is the company's vision statement:

<vision_statement>
{{VISION_STATEMENT}}
</vision_statement>

Follow these steps to create quarterly team OKRs mapped to measurable product milestones:

1. Carefully read and analyze the vision statement.

2. Break down the vision into 3-5 key areas or themes that represent the main components of the company's goals.

3. For each key area, create 1-2 objectives. Objectives should be:
   - Ambitious yet achievable
   - Qualitative
   - Time-bound (quarterly in this case)
   - Action-oriented

4. For each objective, develop 2-4 key results. Key results should be:
   - Quantitative and measurable
   - Specific and time-bound
   - Challenging but realistic

5. Ensure that each key result is directly related to a product milestone or a measurable outcome that contributes to the objective.

6. Review your OKRs to ensure they align with the original vision statement and provide a clear roadmap for the quarter.

7. Organize your OKRs in the following format:

<okrs>
Key Area 1:
Objective 1:
- Key Result 1
- Key Result 2
- Key Result 3

Key Area 2:
Objective 1:
- Key Result 1
- Key Result 2
- Key Result 3

Objective 2:
- Key Result 1
- Key Result 2
- Key Result 3

(Continue for all key areas, objectives, and key results)
</okrs>

Remember to make your OKRs specific to the company's vision and industry. Avoid generic OKRs that could apply to any business. Use concrete numbers and percentages in your key results whenever possible.

After creating the OKRs, briefly explain how each key area and its corresponding OKRs relate to the original vision statement. This explanation should be included after the OKRs, within <explanation> tags.

Finally, review your OKRs one last time to ensure they are challenging yet achievable within a quarter, and that they provide clear direction for teams to translate the broad vision into actionable product milestones.
