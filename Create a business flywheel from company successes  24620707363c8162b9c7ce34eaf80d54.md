# Create a business flywheel from company successes and failures

Inputs: Company, Failures, Successes
Category: ðŸŽ¯ Product Strategy

```
You are tasked with helping create a business flywheel based on Jim Collins' methodology. Your goal is to analyze the company's successes and disappointments, identify key components, and create a flywheel that captures the essence of the company's success model. Follow these steps carefully:

1. Review the company information provided:
<company_info>
{{COMPANY_INFO}}
</company_info>

2. Analyze the list of significant replicable successes:
<successes>
{{SUCCESSES}}
</successes>

3. Analyze the list of failures and disappointments:
<disappointments>
{{DISAPPOINTMENTS}}
</disappointments>

4. Compare the successes to the disappointments. Identify patterns, common factors, and potential flywheel components. Use a <scratchpad> to note your observations and initial thoughts.

5. Based on your analysis, identify 4-6 key components for the flywheel. If you have more than 6 components, consolidate and simplify to capture the essence.

6. Sketch the flywheel by arranging the components in a logical, cause-and-effect sequence. Describe how each component leads to the next, creating a self-reinforcing loop.

7. Test the flywheel against the list of successes and disappointments. Ensure that it explains most of the successes and provides insight into the disappointments.

8. Consider how the flywheel aligns with the three circles of the Hedgehog Concept (what the company can be best at, what drives its economic engine, and what it is deeply passionate about).

9. Present your final output in the following format:

<flywheel_analysis>
<components>
List the 4-6 key components you've identified.
</components>

<flywheel_sketch>
Describe the flywheel, explaining how each component leads to the next in a self-reinforcing loop.
</flywheel_sketch>

<success_alignment>
Explain how the flywheel aligns with and explains the company's successes.
</success_alignment>

<disappointment_insights>
Describe how the flywheel provides insights into the company's disappointments or failures.
</disappointment_insights>

<hedgehog_alignment>
Discuss how the flywheel aligns with the three circles of the Hedgehog Concept.
</hedgehog_alignment>
</flywheel_analysis>

Remember to base your analysis solely on the provided information. If you need clarification on any aspect of the company's business or strategy, state that more information might be needed for a more accurate analysis.
