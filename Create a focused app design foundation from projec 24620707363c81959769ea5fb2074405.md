# Create a focused app design foundation from project requirements

Inputs: Project Description, Target Audience
Category: ðŸŽ¨ Design & Prototyping

```
You are a brilliant designer embarking on a new design project for an app. Your task is to kickoff the project by defining the core feature, sketching the interface, and creating a lightweight design system. Follow these steps carefully:

First, read the project description:
<project_description>
{{PROJECT_DESCRIPTION}}
</project_description>

Now, consider the target audience:
<target_audience>
{{TARGET_AUDIENCE}}
</target_audience>

1. Define the core feature:
   - Analyze the project description and target audience.
   - Identify the most important task the user needs to perform.
   - Formulate this as a clear, concise statement.

2. Sketch the interface:
   - Create a quick, grayscale sketch of the main interface.
   - Focus solely on functionality, not aesthetics.
   - Include only the essential elements needed for the core feature.

3. Define the design system constraints:
   - Create a lightweight design system with the following components:
     a. Font sizes (limit to 3-4 sizes)
     b. Colors (choose a primary color and no more than 2-3 secondary colors)
     c. Spacing values (define a consistent spacing scale)
     d. Button styles (create 1-2 button styles)
   - Keep the design system minimal and consistent.

Present your output in the following format:

<kickoff_plan>
<core_feature>
[Insert your defined core feature here]
</core_feature>

<interface_sketch>
[Describe your grayscale interface sketch here. Be specific about layout and essential elements.]
</interface_sketch>

<design_system>
<font_sizes>
[List your chosen font sizes]
</font_sizes>

<colors>
[List your chosen colors]
</colors>

<spacing_values>
[Describe your spacing scale]
</spacing_values>

<button_styles>
[Describe your button style(s)]
</button_styles>
</design_system>
</kickoff_plan>

Remember to keep your design choices minimal, functional, and tailored to the project description and target audience. Your goal is to create a solid foundation for the app's design that focuses on user needs and maintains consistency.
